Dear User,

When using our jQuery library, you need to make sure several conditions are met on your side. Firstly, please check whether the DOM elements containing the different page contents have `id` attributes set. Then, using these attribute values you need to select the corresponding DOM elements using the jQuery DOM selection. 

Here is an example:

* In your html document:
```
<div id="my-content><div>"
```

* In your JavaScript code
```
var myContent = $('#my-content');
```
Feel free to contact us for feedback or if you have further questions regarding our product.

Best regards
